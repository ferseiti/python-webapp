# python-webapp
Simple python webapp written in django using mysql. This was written following the Django tutorial (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01).

This is intended to be a small webapp to run on a server.
It will just store data in a mysql database.

To get it up:
```bash
python manage.py runserver <port>
```
Where \<port\> is the port where it will be available.
